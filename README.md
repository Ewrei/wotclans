# wotclans
The source code for the [World of Tanks for Console Clans Site](https://wotclans.com.br/) and [Discord Bot](https://wotclans.com.br/DiscordBot)

## What is this?

It's the full source code of the site (and related tools) [WotClans](https://wotclans.com.br/). It tracks the performance of clan players on the
[World of Tanks](https://console.worldoftanks.com/) (for consoles) game, by Wargaming.

## Architeture

I need to explain soon(tm) how this whole think works... it's not trivial.

## Database

It's very large, and needs explanation and a way to share... Soon.

## Contribute

Why not? Altought this is more like a "full disclosure" iniciative more than giving away control of the project, feel free to contact me. There are a few places
that I would love to have some help:

* Translations to German, Russian, Spanish...
* A more "mobile friendly" main view...
* etc

## FAQ

1) Can I copy your project, database, and open up my version of it with beer, hookers and ads?

   Sure! By all means! It's MIT licensed.

2) There are comments in Spanish on the code!

   Actually they are in Portuguese, my usual language. They will be translated, eventually.

3) Your code sucks! Will you improve it?

   Nah! It has a purpose, a reason, and works very fine giving the constraints of cost in running and maintening the site. But of course I will inprove it, and suggestions
   on how to inprove, refactor and so on are wellcome.

4) I love you! Thanks! Can I use snippets of your code?

   I love you too! And sure, You can!
